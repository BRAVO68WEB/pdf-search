Check [Database Schema](./types/database.d.ts) for more details.

## Environment Variables üåç

To run the project, you need to set up the following environment variables:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=                   // Groq API Key
CSE_API_KEY=                    // Google Custom Search Engine API Key
CSE_CX_ID=                      // Google Custom Search Engine CX ID
DATABASE_URL=                   // PostgreSQL Database URL
R2_BUCKET_NAME=                 // Cloudflare R2 Bucket Name
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=               // Cloudflare R2 Access Key ID

```

## Deployment üöÄ

The project is deployed on Cloudflare Workers. The deployment is managed using Wrangler. To deploy the project, run the following command:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

The Project is also deployed to CloudFlare Workers using Github Actions. The deployment is triggered on every push to the main branch
